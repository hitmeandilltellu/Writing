Nipples

Be unusual
—Commercials are targeted at demographics, so everyone in the commercial has to be normal or part of a recognized sub-group.
—Weird poster


Swear.
—Seriously, 42 years After George you still can’t say shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, or tits in a commercial. Or any other swear words, really. Like…


Talk about the cost
—Life is pain, princess
—War, dead soldiers, destruction


Suggest balance
—Commercials are all about convincing you that one thing is perfectly, ultimately, universally good. This is never true in life, every thing has ups and downs, and you have to balance those out. Neither end of the spectrum is ever right, the answer is always in the middle.
—This is very much related to “talk about the cost.” It should be transitioned like, “And because of that, you can’t…”
-self control


Be quiet for ten seconds
—Commercials offer other people’s perspectives. The more time they fill up in my life, the more activities I let them take over, the less I can come up with my own perspective, my own personality. I’m reactionary, composed only of my responses to other people’s messages because I desperately avoid any second of quiet in which my brain might be expected to squeeze out a thought of its own.
—You become who you listen to


Suggest people break the law
--Show people breaking the law without reprocussions
--Say anything good about prison, or talk about it at all, really


Girls kissing
--Slip a pic of two dudes going at it in there too
